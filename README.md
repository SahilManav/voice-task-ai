# VoiceDesk — Voice-First AI Task Manager

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Visit%20App-violet?style=for-the-badge)](https://voice-task-ai-eight.vercel.app)

A MERN-stack task manager where the primary input method is natural language voice. Speak a command like *"Remind me to submit the quarterly report by next Friday"* and the app extracts structured task data automatically — no forms required.

Built for the Senpiper Engineering Assignment (Option A: Voice-First Task App).

## ✨ Features

- **Voice-to-task extraction** — speak naturally, the app parses title, priority, and due date automatically using the browser's native Speech Recognition API
- **Full task lifecycle** — create, complete, delete, and **delay/postpone** tasks, all controllable by voice or manually
- **Spoken feedback** — the assistant confirms actions out loud via text-to-speech
- **Structured voice command summary** — see exactly what was parsed (action, priority, due date) before confirming
- **JWT authentication** — secure per-user task data
- **Analytics dashboard** — real KPIs computed from your actual tasks:
  - Completion Ratio
  - Tasks Completed On Time
  - Pending Tasks
  - Delayed Tasks
  - Weekly Productivity Graph (real completions per day, last 7 days)
- **Modern dark-mode UI** — built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, lucide-react, react-hot-toast, react-router-dom, axios |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose |
| Auth | JSON Web Tokens (JWT) |
| Voice | Browser-native Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` + `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`) — no external voice API required |
| Command Parsing | Custom rule-based natural language parser (client-side) |

## 🗣️ Voice Commands You Can Try

| Say this | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Create task submit assignment tomorrow high priority" | Creates a new task with the extracted title, due date, and priority |
| "Complete grocery run" | Marks the matching task as completed |
| "Delete old task" | Removes the matching task |
| "Delay grocery task to tomorrow" | Postpones the matching task, sets a new target date |
| "Remind me to call the dentist next Monday" | Creates a task due next Monday |

The parser understands relative dates (`today`, `tomorrow`, `next week`), weekdays (`Friday`, `next Monday`), and priority keywords (`urgent`, `high priority`, `low priority`).

## 🚀 Getting Started (Quick Setup — 5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18+ ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **MongoDB** connection string:
  - **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Free cloud database at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (no installation needed)
  - **Option 2**: Local MongoDB installed on your machine

### 1. Clone the repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SahilManav/voice-task-ai.git
cd voice-task-ai
```

### 2. Set up the backend
```powershell
cd server
npm install
```

Create a **`.env`** file inside **`server/`** folder:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster.mongodb.net/voice-task-ai?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_random_string_here_min_32_chars
NODE_ENV=development
```

> 🔑 **Important:**
> - Replace `MONGODB_URI` with your actual MongoDB connection string
> - Generate a strong random string for `JWT_SECRET` (at least 32 characters)
> - Never commit your `.env` file

**Start the backend:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```
✅ **Success message:** You should see `MongoDB Connected` and `Server running on http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Set up the frontend
Open a **new** PowerShell terminal (keep the backend running):
```powershell
cd voice-task-ai\client
npm install
```

Create a **`.env`** file inside **`client/`** folder:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

**Start the frontend:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```
✅ **Success:** App available at **`http://localhost:5173`**

### 4. Use the app
1. Open **Chrome** or **Edge** browser (required for voice features)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Register** a new account
4. **Login** with your credentials
5. Click the **microphone icon** 🎤 in the Voice Assistant panel
6. Try saying: *"Create task buy groceries tomorrow high priority"*
7. Explore the **Analytics** tab to see real-time task metrics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"**
- Check your MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (allow `0.0.0.0/0` for testing)
- Verify your connection string is correct in `server/.env`

**Issue: "Voice input not working"**
- Use **Chrome** or **Edge** browser (Firefox/Safari don't support Web Speech API)
- Allow microphone permissions when prompted
- Check that your microphone is working in system settings

**Issue: "Port already in use"**
- Backend: Change `PORT` in `server/.env` to a different number (e.g., 5001)
- Frontend: Vite usually auto-assigns a new port if 5173 is busy

**Issue: "JWT authentication failed"**
- Clear browser localStorage and register a new account
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set in `server/.env`

## 🎙️ Browser Support Note
Voice input relies on the Web Speech API, which has the best support in **Chrome** and **Edge**. Firefox and Safari have limited or no support for `SpeechRecognition`.

## 🧭 Design Decisions Under Ambiguity

The assignment intentionally left some requirements open to interpretation. Key decisions made, with reasoning, are documented in [`rules.md`](./rules.md). Highlights:

- **Task status model**: added a dedicated `status` field (`active/completed/cancelled/delayed`) alongside the existing `completed` boolean, rather than replacing it — this kept all existing functionality working while adding support for the full lifecycle the assignment requires.
- **Task matching for voice actions** (complete/delete/delay): since users don't speak a task ID, matching is done via word-overlap against existing task titles. This is simple and effective for the assignment's scope, with a known limitation for tasks with very similar titles.

## 🗺️ Future Scope

- Smarter task matching (fuzzy matching / ranking instead of strict word-overlap)
- Distinguish "Cancelled" from "Deleted" as separate states
- Configurable voice settings (speech rate, language)
- Push/email reminders for upcoming due dates
- Deploy to Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend) for a live demo link
